# Synthetic-Data-Modelling

I  have created  5 notebooks, the details will be given below. Each notebook has a specific kind of dataset and is being run on 6 models for 100 times. The details for each model ,seeding and epoch is being explored in the notebook. 

Details and link of  each notebook is here:

1)Synthetic Data and Models_V2.1 : In this there is a general dataset as per the professor writeup given earlier.

2)Synthetic Data and Models_V2.2: In this the data is gaussian normally distributed.

3)Synthetic Data and Models_V2.3: In this the Y is dependent on X(n) and as well as X(n-1).

4)Synthetic Data and Models_V2.4: In this the sparse matrix is being added to the  general dataset as per the professor writeup given earlier.

5)Synthetic Data and Models_V2.5: In this the sparse matrix is being added to data where Y is depending on X(n) and as well as X(n-1).
